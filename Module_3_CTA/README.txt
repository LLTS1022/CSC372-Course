User Interface with Menu in Java Swing
This project is a simple Java Swing GUI application that provides a menu bar with four options:

Print Date & Time → Displays the current date and time in a text box.
Save to File → Writes the text box content to log.txt.
Change Background Color → Randomly selects a green hue and changes the frame background color.
Exit → Closes the application.
